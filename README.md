# PC-Engine IFU-30 Reverse engineering
This repository contains:
* kicad files of the main PCB schematics
* kicad files of the RAM mezzanine PCB
* wiki page to explain the circuitry

Potential future development:
* creation of a compatible PCB using SMD component to shrink the board a bit and include RAM on it as well
* add a header for an easy RGB modification
